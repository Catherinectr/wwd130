        <p>

            I'm Catherine from India, majoring in Computer Information and Technology. My goal is to become a Product Manager in the IT industry.<br>
            I'm also a mother of a 4-year-old boy, enjoy music and dancing, and appreciate that BYUI allows me to combine education with my faith <br>
            as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Despite some initial nervousness, I'm eager to progress in my coursework.<br>
            In my journey toward this career, I look forward to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of both front-end and back-end web development,<br>
            which I believe will be essential for my future role. My 15 years of commitment to the Church have shaped my values and work ethic, which I <br>
            plan to bring into my professional life as a Product Manager.
